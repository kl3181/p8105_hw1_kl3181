## Problem 1
##### Creating a data frame comprised of a random sample of size 10 from a normal distribution, a logical vector, a character vector length of 10 and a factor vector length of 10 with 3 levels.
```{r create df}
library(tidyverse)

prob1 = 
tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
  char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "mod", "high", "high", "high"))
)
```
